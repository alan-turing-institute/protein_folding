# Summary

Visualise and explore protein structures across time. Incorporate vis of protein amino acid strand (1D), secondary (2D), tertiary structures (3D) across time. Only 2D and 3D are dependent on time.


# Key Functionalities
Visualise any PDB file and create interpolation between two states.
Create custom slices of chains of Amino Acids.
Visualise Heavy water data
Configure protein visualisations (3 LODs)
Animate between 2 states

# Installation
1. Download, create an account and install [Rhino3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) v. 7 or higher*. 
2. Download and install [Human UI](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/human-ui) for Rhino Grasshopper (If not already installed with Rhino) NOTE!: Human UI does not work for Mac
3. Clone this repository in your pc.
4. Load the visual editor grasshopper by typing "grasshopper" in the Rhino's command line.
5. Open or drag and drop the ProteinGenerator.gh file into grasshopper. 


(*) There is a 3 month trial version available for Rhino, which you can download for free. 
Please look at minimum specifications for running Rhino [here](https://www.rhino3d.com/7/system-requirements/).
